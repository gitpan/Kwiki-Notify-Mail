NAME
    Kwiki::Notify::Mail - send an email when a page is updated

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     $ cd /path/to/kwiki
     $ kwiki -add Kwiki::Notify::Mail
     $ cat config/notify_mail.yaml >> config.yaml
     $ edit config.yaml

REQUIRES
    This module requires MIME::Lite to send email.

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to notify yourself by email when some one updates
    a page. You can specify the To:, From: and Subject: headers, but the
    email message body is not currently configurable.

    A sample email looks like:

     Content-Disposition: inline
     Content-Length: 52
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
     Content-Type: text/plain
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     X-Mailer: MIME::Lite 3.01 (F2.72; B3.01; Q3.01)
     Date: Sun, 29 Aug 2004 22:00:31 UT
     To: geo_bush@casablanca.gov
     From: nobody@countykerry.ir
     Subject: Kwiki page update

     Kwiki page LotsOfWikiWords edited by AnonymousGnome

  Configuration Directives
    * notify_mail_to
        Specify the mail address you are sending to.

    * notify_mail_from
        Specify the address this is apparently from.

    * notify_mail_subject
        Specify a subject line for the mail message. You can make use of
        sprintf()-type formatting codes (%s is the only one that is
        relevant). If you put or more %s in the configuration directive it
        will print out the site title, page name and whom it was edited by.
        You can can't change the order, however.

        Examples:

         notify_mail_subject: Kwiki was updated

        gives you the Subject: line

         Subject: Kwiki was updated

        If your site title (defined in site_title in config.yaml) was
        'ProjectDiscussion', then

         notify_mail_subject: My wiki %s was updated

        gives you the Subject: line

         Subject: My wiki ProjectDiscussion was updated

        Next you can add the page name with a second %s. If the updated page
        happened to be 'NextWeeksAgenda', the configuration directive

         notify_mail_subject: My wiki %s page %s was updated

        gives you the Subject: line

         Subject: My wiki ProjectDiscussion page NextWeeksAgenda was updated

        Finally, a third %s gives you the name of the person who edited the
        page:

         notify_mail_subject: My wiki %s page %s was updated by %s

         Subject: My wiki ProjectDiscussion page NextWeeksAgenda was updated
         by PointyHairedBoss

        The important thing to remember is that you can have either none or
        one or two or three %s, but you can't change the order. The default
        value is

         notify_mail_subject: %s wiki page %s updated by %s

        which should be fine for most people.

    * notify_mail_debug
        When set, saves the mail message to /tmp/kwiki_notify_mail.txt
        instead of sending it.

    statico. The style of this module has been adapted from statico's
    Kwiki::Notify::IRC.

BUGS
    The subject line configuration relies on sprintf() which doesn't allow
    you to change the order of what gets printed out.

    The debug file is saved to /tmp and should be user configurable. This
    module was not tested under Windows and certainly /tmp doesn't exist
    there.

    be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
